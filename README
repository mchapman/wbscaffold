Usage

  1.  In MySQL Workbench do Scripting | Install Plugin / Module File... and
      select lib/rails_utils.grt.lua
  2.  Open your diagram in MySQL Workbench and select Plugins | Catalog | Copy
      Rails Structure to Clipboard
  3.  Save the contents of the clipboard to a file
  4.  Run the program as follows:
         ruby main.rb -input=TextFileFromStep3 -railsbase=FolderForRailsProject
      for example
         ruby main.rb -input=/home/mark/Documents/Structure.exp
                        -railsbase=/home/mark/Projects/TestScaff

  This is my first Ruby program so you may need to modify the source slightly -
  please let me know if this is case.

Flags
